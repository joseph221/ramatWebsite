                <h3>Rights of women in tour guiding</h3>
                <p>Tanzania as a developing country, it's economy depends on the tourism industry. Over over 362,327 kmÂ² which is equal to 43.7 % of its territory is protected land under different categories including national parks, game reserve, forest and marine reserves as per UNEP and IUCN report on 2019.</p>
                <p>Statistics shows  women are not fully involved on  protection and utilisation of tourism products despite global, regional and country measures and interventions taken to promote women right  to work. It is unfortunate that other policies, laws and practices undermine such right. </p>
                <ol>
                    Thus, Ramat Tanzania seek to
                    <li>promote female guides and park rangers</li>
                    <li>provide training and confidence building</li>
                    <li>employment opportunities </li>
                </ol>
               <p>And work closely to the government and other stakeholders looking  for the possibilities of  amendment of some policies and laws to harmonise and make them effective and efficient in protecting the right of women in the tourism industry.</p>
